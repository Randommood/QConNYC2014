# Computational Patterns of the Cloud
[QCon NYC 2014](https://qconnewyork.com/presentation/computational-patterns-cloud) - The Evolving Cloud Track - 4:15pm - 5:05pm

The Cloud has undoubtedly changed the way we think about computing, IT operations, innovation, and entrepreneurship. But what are the computational patterns that have emerged from the pervasiveness of public clouds? What can we leverage to improve our organizations? And what are the challenges that we face going forward?

In this talk, I will introduce you to cloud computing’s paradigms and discuss their applications with practical examples from Engine Yard’s customers, peers, and partners. We will also cover antipatterns and myths. If you are curious about Cloud computing or want to improve your cloud strategy this talk is for you.
